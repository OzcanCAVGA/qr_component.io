### What I learned

The HTML file is a basic structure with the necessary tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, and meta tags.

The HTML file includes a link to a stylesheet file named style.css using the <link> tag in the <head> section.

The stylesheet file style.css imports a Google font named Lato and Outfit font, which is used as the main font family for the webpage.

The stylesheet file defines some CSS variables using :root selector to set the primary color, light gray, grayish-blue, and dark blue color codes.

The * selector is used to reset the margin and padding of all elements in the HTML file.

The stylesheet file defines a box-shadow effect for the #box ID element.

The .main-content class is used to center the container element in the middle of the page using the flexbox display property.

The .container class is used to define the container element that holds the QR code image and the content.

The .container class also sets a fixed width of 288px and aligns the content to the center of the container using flexbox properties.

The stylesheet file defines styles for the QR code image, including a maximum width of 90% and a border radius of 1rem.

The stylesheet file also sets the font size, color, and margin for the content inside the container element using .container .content and .container .content p and .container .content h6 selectors.

Lastly, the stylesheet file defines a media query that adjusts the width of the .main-content class for screens smaller than 500px.
